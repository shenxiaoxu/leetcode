Given a list of positive integers nums and an int target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a target - 30.

Conditions:

You will pick exactly 2 numbers.
You cannot pick the same element twice.
If you have muliple pairs, select the pair with the largest number.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 10, 25, 35, 60], target = 90
Output: [2, 3]
Explanation:
nums[2] + nums[3] = 25 + 35 = 60 = 90 - 30
Example 2:

Input: nums = [20, 50, 40, 25, 30, 10], target = 90
Output: [1, 5]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[2] = 20 + 40 = 60 = 90 - 30
nums[1] + nums[5] = 50 + 10 = 60 = 90 - 30
You should return the pair with the largest number.*/

/*You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  
You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Example 2:

Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30*/
